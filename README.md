# Classic Game Builders: Cursor Edition

This repository includes classic computer games generated using the Cursor AI coding environment. It is part of a research project focused on understanding AI-assisted software engineering and gameplay behavior.

## 🤖 Agent: Cursor IDE

All code here was produced using Cursor’s in-editor AI assistant. The agent was prompted to construct modular games from scratch, based on detailed architecture and logic instructions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo evaluates Cursor’s ability to:

- Scaffold and implement known game logic
- Follow a modular design plan
- Generate readable, maintainable code with minimal intervention
- Compete with other agents like Codex and Jules in output quality

## 🔍 Repository Status

- **View-Only**: No contributions or issues are accepted in this repository. It exists purely for documentation and review.
- **License**: MIT License

---

## 🧱 Core Components

Games are organized with the following components:

- **Game Logic Engine**
- **React/Tailwind User Interface**
- **Agent Strategy Layer (optional)**
- **Structured + Natural Language Logging**
- **Unified Game Manager for plug-and-play AI**

All output is retained as a record of Cursor’s coding abilities, not as production-ready software.

## 🧠 Project Collaboration

This project was conceived, scoped, and architected by **Mark1999**, with strategic support and iterative design assistance provided by **Moira**—a customized instance of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Moira contributed to:

- Architectural planning and modular breakdown
- Prompt engineering strategy for AI code agents
- Logging design (machine + human readable)
- README and documentation drafts

Moira did not write game code. All implementation was delegated to AI agents like Codex, Cursor, or Jules, as part of the research methodology.
